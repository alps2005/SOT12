# SOT12
## Project Information
This project was developed by Adrian Palma, student of Universidad Ecotec.
This project was an interesting way to learn more about web development and how the technologies that I thought were
obsolete are still essential in the development of this kind of projects. This took me 3  days to finish with the help of AI agent using Cursor Text editor and Youtube Videos (the videos were more helpfull) to guide me through this journy. I'll leave the links here:
